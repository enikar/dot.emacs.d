;;; Commentary:

;; These are just shortcuts. `Z' is used as prefix key.
;; We use eyebrowse's slot as a vim's tab.
;;
;; | Key binding | Description                 |
;; |:-----------:|-----------------------------|
;; | `ZC'        | Create new slot             |
;; | `ZQ'        | Close current slot          |
;; | `ZN'        | Goto next slot              |
;; | `ZP'        | Goto previous slot          |
;; | `ZA'        | Switch other slot           |
;; | `Z0'        | Switch to slot 10           |
;; | `Z1'        | Switch to slot 1            |
;; | `Z2'        | Switch to slot 2            |
;; | `Z3'        | Switch to slot 3            |
;; | `Z4'        | Switch to slot 4            |
;; | `Z5'        | Switch to slot 5            |
;; | `Z6'        | Switch to slot 6            |
;; | `Z7'        | Switch to slot 7            |
;; | `Z8'        | Switch to slot 8            |
;; | `Z9'        | Switch to slot 9            |
;; | `Z"'        | Choose a slot interactively |

;; go to next and previous slot respectively.
